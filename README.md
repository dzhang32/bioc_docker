# Docker image with commonly-used R packages installed and R/git configured

[This docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dzhang32/bioc_docker) is built upon [bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_X_XX](https://hub.docker.com/u/bioconductor/). It contains the `R` packages that I most commonly use, as well as the configurations for `R`/`git` setup using [rutils::setup_r_git()](https://dzhang32.github.io/rutils/reference/setup_r_git.html).
